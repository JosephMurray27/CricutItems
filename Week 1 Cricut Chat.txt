00:41:00	Happy Shaz:	Fantastic, thank you. :-)

00:41:42	Donnell Layne:	Welcome everyone!
00:43:18	Donnell Layne:	I‚Äôm Donnell Layne - the Director of the iMake Innovation Center
00:43:19	Brenda Evaristo:	https://design.cricut.com/
00:43:39	Donnell Layne:	Thank you all for joining us today
00:45:28	Diane Dishman:	ok
00:45:30	Happy Shaz:	Thumbs up from me, lol
00:45:44	Norma Monroy:	Ok
00:58:56	Nancy:	Is there any issue using the Disney font for stuff that you plan to sell?
00:59:58	Happy Shaz:	Here in the UK we cannot legally use anything Disney
01:00:27	patrick:	If Disney decides to pursue you, you are in trouble. They don't always but it is risky.
01:01:20	Nancy:	makes sense. thanks!
01:02:35	Happy Shaz:	I personally do not use anything with any chance of copyright/ownership, it really is not worth the risk. A lot of companies are getting very keen on finding people using their 'product'
01:02:46	patrick:	^
01:03:17	Donnell Layne:	And it disrupts your progress especially if you create a ‚Äúhot‚Äù product
01:03:33	Donnell Layne:	https://www.1001freefonts.com/
01:04:25	patrick:	Yes. Either pay for it or use a free repository like Donnell shared.
01:04:31	Donnell Layne:	https://unsplash.com/
